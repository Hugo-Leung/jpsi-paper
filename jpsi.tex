\section{Introduction}

The SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab was designed to measure high-mass dimuons
produced in the interaction of \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam with various targets
including liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium, and solid nuclear
targets~\cite{aidala2019}. Dimuons
originating from the Drell-Yan process~\cite{drell1970} as well as from the
decay of charmonium
states ($J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$) were collected simultaneously.
Results from SeaQuest on the $(p+d) / (p+p)$ Drell-Yan cross section ratio,
which is sensitive
to the $\bar d / \bar u$ flavor asymmetry in the proton, were reported
recently~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}. In this paper, we present results from
SeaQuest on the $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$ charmonium production in $p+p$
and $p+d$ interactions with \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam.

Unlike the Drell-Yan process which primarily involves the
quark - antiquark annihilation via electromagnetic interaction, charmonium
production proceeds via strong interaction containing contributions from
both the quark-antiquark annihilation and the gluon-gluon
fusion processes. The simultaneous measurement of these two very different
processes provides complimentary
information on the partonic structures of the nucleon. In particular,
the $(p+d) / (p+p)$ cross section ratio for charmonium production is expected
to be sensitive to the ratio of the gluon distributions in the proton
and deuteron.

Charge symmetry (CS) operation corresponds to
a rotation of $180^\circ$ along the second axis of the
isospin space. This operation interchanges up and down quarks, as well
as proton and neutron.
%Evidence for the violation of charge symmetry at the hadronic level has been
%reported in interactions such as the $d d \to {\pi^0}~^4\mbox{He}$
%reaction~\cite{stephenson2003}
%and the $n p \to \pi^0 d$ reaction~\cite{opper2003}.
Violation of charge symmetry is predicted at the
partonic level, although there exists no experimental evidence
so far~\cite{londergan2010}. Since gluon is an iso-scalar particle, charge symmetry
requires that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron
should be identical. A sensitive measurement of the
gluon contents in proton and neutron could provide a test of CS at
the partonic level~\cite{piller1996,zhu2008,lansberg2012}.

While proton-induced charmonium production is generally dominated
by the gluon-gluon fusion process~\cite{vogt1999}, the
quark-antiquark annihilation process can also contribute.
The quark-antiquark annihilation is sensitive to the
$\bar{d} / \bar{u}$ flavor asymmetry in the proton, while the
gluon-gluon fusion is sensitive to the gluon contents in proton and
neutron. The relative importance of these two
processes depends on the beam energy as well as on the
Feynman-$x$ ($x_F$) of the charmonium~\cite{peng1995}. Therefore, the
beam-energy and the $x_F$ dependencies
of the $(p+d) / (p+p)$ cross section ratio for $J/\psi$ production
could reveal the relative importance of these two processes.

The NA51 Collaboration reported a measurement of the $(p+d) / (p+p)$ cross
section ratios for charmonium production at \SI{450}{\GeV} at a single value of
rapidity ($x_F \sim 0.$)~\cite{abreu1998}. The present measurement covers the
kinematic range of $0.3 < x_F < 0.8$. The lower beam energy of \SI{120}{\GeV}
for the SeaQuest experiment is also expected to probe
the parton distributions at larger values of $x$, the fractional momentum
carried by the partons, than accessed by the NA51 experiment at \SI{450}{\GeV}.

%The organization of this paper is as follows. Following this introduction,
%the SeaQuest experiment will be described in Section II.
%Section III will present the procedure for data analysis and Monte-Carlo
%simulation. Results of the $x_F$ dependencies of the $p+d$ and $p+p$
%cross sections will be presented in Section IV. 
%will be presented in Section IV. The $(p+d)/(p+p)$ $J/\Psi$ cross section
%ratios will be compared with the Drell-Yan ratios, followed by Conclusions.

\section{The SeaQuest Experiment}

The SeaQuest experiment was performed using a \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam from the
Fermilab Main Injector. The SeaQuest dimuon spectrometer was designed for
detecting high-mass dimuon pairs produced in the interaction of proton
with various targets. Details of the SeaQuest spectrometer can be found
elsewhere~\cite{aidala2019,dove2021,dove2023}. A primary proton beam containing
up to $6 \times 10^{12}$ protons in a 4-second long beam spill every minute
was incident upon one of three identical \SI{50.8}{\cm} long cylindrical
stainless steel
target flasks. The targets alternated between liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium,
and the empty flask targets. A Beam Intensity Monitor (BIM) Cherenkov counter
was placed in the beam to record the instantaneous proton intensity for
each \SI{1}{\ns} long RF bucket at \SI{53}{\MHz} repetition rate.
%The BIM is essential
%for measuring the integrated beam luminosity, and to inhibit triggers
%occuring within RF buckets containing large number of protons 
%exceeding a preset threshold. 
%This significantly reduces the data-acquisition
%deadtime by not triggering on events which are too noisy to be 
%reliably reconstructed.

The SeaQuest spectrometer consists of two dipole magnets and
four detector stations equipped with hodoscopes and tracking chambers.
Central to the spectrometer are two large dipole magnets.
The first magnet downstream of the target is a solid iron magnet which
also serves as a beam-dump and a hadron absorber. The second
magnet serves as a momentum analyzing magnet. Dimuon events
were triggered based on the requirement of a triple hodoscope
coincidence with a pattern consistent with a muon pair originating
from the target. Various diagnostic triggers were also implemented.
In particular, the ``single-muon" trigger was used to evaluate the
accidental dimuon
background. The ``random" trigger sampled the
detector response during the data-taking.

%Monte-Carlo simulation of the experiment.

\section{Data Analysis}

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{crossSections/xF/cs_xF_full}
	\caption{The differential cross
		section per nucleon $d\sigma / d x_F$ for $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$
		production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ interaction at \SI{120}{\GeV}.
		The curves correspond to NRQCD calculation using the LDMEs obtained
		in \cite{chang2023} and the nucleon PDFs from \cite{hou2021}.}
	\label{fig:cs_xF}
\end{figure}

The SeaQuest data sets are separated into two parts, each containing
roughly half of the total collected data. The first part includes data
taken between June 2014 and July 2015, and the second part covered the
remaining period up to July 2017.
Results on the analysis of the Drell-Yan events from the first data set
have already been reported~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}. For the charmonium data
reported in this paper, we have analyzed the full SeaQuest data sets.
Since the trigger conditions and the detector configuration for the two
data sets are not identical, the analysis was performed
separately for each data set. Results obtained from the two data sets
are first compared to check their consistency, and then combined for
the final results.

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{crossSections/pT/cs_pT_full}
	\caption{The differential cross
		$d\sigma / d p^2_T$ per nucleon for $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$
		production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ interaction at \SI{120}{\GeV}.
		The curves correspond to fits using the Kaplan form described in the
		text.}
	\label{fig:cs_pT}
\end{figure}

Tracks reconstructed in the drift chambers were extrapolated
to the target region. Only dimuon events consistent with originating
from the target were selected. The target
position was then used to
refine the parameters of each muon pair. The resulting
RMS mass resolution for $J/\psi$ is $\sim$\SI{200}{\MeV}.
This resolution is dominated by the finite target length and the
multiple scattering of muons in the iron magnet.

\Cref{Fig:LD2_Mass} shows the dimuon mass spectrum for the data
collected with the
liquid deuterium target for the second data set. A comparison with the
dimuon mass spectrum obtained for the first data set,
reported in~\cite{dove2023}, shows
a small but noticeable difference attributed to the different
trigger conditions.

To extract the yields of $J/\psi$ and
$\psi^\prime$, the dimuon mass spectrum was fitted by
including several components. First, the
data collected with empty target flask
are used to determine the background originating from sources other than the
liquid target. Second, a Monte-Carlo (M-C) based on
GEANT4 was performed to obtain the expected line shapes of the $J/\psi$
and $\psi^\prime$ resonances. It first generated the ``clean"
dimuon events, which were then embedded by the additional hits in the detectors
according to the data collected with the ``random" trigger. This
procedure ensures that the spectrometer responses to the background hits
are properly taken into account.
Third, dimuons from the Drell-Yan process are simulated using
next-to-leading order
calculation with the CTEQ14 parton distributions.
%These M-C
%Drell-Yan events were generated using next-to-leading order
%calculations and the CTEQ14 parton distributions.
The embedding procedure was also applied to the Drell-Yan M-C data.
Finally, the accidental background, caused by two independent
interactions within the same RF bucket, is simulated
by forming a random combination of data collected with the
``single-muon" trigger, as discussed in detail in Ref.~\cite{dove2023}.
These embedded M-C events were then analyzed by applying cuts identical
to those for the real data.

A fit to the $p+d$ dimuon data,
allowing the normalizations of
the various components except the empty flask data to vary, is
shown in \cref{Fig:LD2_Mass}.
The data are well described by the combination of various
components. The adequacy of this approach is further supported by the excellent
agreement for the extracted Drell-Yan $(p+d) / (p+p)$ cross section ratio
between this method~\cite{dove2023} and an independent intensity-extrapolation
method adopted in Ref.~\cite{dove2021}.

%Figure~\ref{Fig:LH2_Mass} shows the dimuon mass distribution for 
%events passing all analysis
%cuts for the data collected on the liquid hydrogen target. The various curves
%in Fig.~\ref{Fig:LH2_Mass} correspond to the different components 
%analogous to those in Fig.~\ref{Fig:LD2_Mass}.
%The good agreement between the data and the fit indicates the suitability of
%this approach to extract the $J/\psi$ yield. Good agreement between the first
%data set and the fit was also obtained for the first data set, as shown in
%Ref.~\cite{Dove22}. 
%Table~\ref{tab:tabyield} 
%shows the numbers of $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$ events for $p+p$ and $p+d$
%extracted from the analysis of both data sets. The mean values of the 
%$x_F$ and $p_T$ kinematic variables 
%are also listed in Table~\ref{tab:tabyield}. We recall
%the following definitions of the $J/\psi$ kinematic variable:
%\begin{equation}
%x_F = \frac{P_L}{P_{max}} = \frac{2P_L}{\sqrt s (1-M^2/s)},
%\label{eq:eq1}
%\end{equation}
%where $P_L$ is the longitudinal momentum of $J/\psi$ and $P_{max}$
%is the maximum momentum for $J/\psi$ in the hadron-hadron center-of-mass
%frame. $M$ and $\sqrt s$ are the $J/\psi$ mass and the hadron-hadron total
%energy, respectively. From the $J/\psi$ four momentum $Q$, the variables
%$x_1$ and $x_2$ are obtained:
%\begin{equation}
%x_1 = \frac{P_2 \cdot Q}{P_1 \cdot P}~~~ \mbox{and}~~~ 
%x_2 = \frac{P_1 \cdot Q}{P_2 \cdot P},
%\label{eq:eq2}
%\end{equation}
%where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the four momenta of the projectile and target hadron,
%respectively, and $P$ is the sum of $P_1$ and $P_2$.

To obtain the charmonium differential cross sections,
the data were split into bins of $x_F$ and $p_T$ and each dimuon mass
spectrum was fitted with the procedure described earlier
to extract the $J/\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$ yield.
We recall the following definitions of $x_F$:
\begin{equation}
	x_F = \frac{2P_L}{\sqrt{s} (1-M^2/s)},
	\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
where $P_L$ is the longitudinal momentum of the charmonium.
$M$ and $\sqrt s$ are the $J/\psi$ mass and the hadron-hadron total
energy, respectively.
The charmonium production cross section is obtained as follows
\begin{equation}
	d\sigma = \frac{Y}{Acc \cdot Eff \cdot Lum},
	\label{eq:eq2}
\end{equation}
where $Y$ is the number of $J/\psi$ or $\psi^\prime$ events
for each $x_F$ or $p_T$ bin, $Acc$ the spectrometer acceptance,
$Eff$ the efficiency for  analysis cuts, and $Lum$ the effective
luminosity including the data-acquisition deadtime.

The values of $d\sigma/ d x_F$ per target nucleon for $J/\psi$ and
$\psi^\prime$ production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ collisions are shown in
\cref{fig:cs_xF} and listed
in \cref{tab:xfcros}. The $d\sigma/ d x_F$ differential cross sections are
obtained by using a $p_T$ distribution in the acceptance calculation
which best fits the data. The systematic uncertainties
include an overall normalization
uncertainty, common to both the $p+p$ and $p+d$ cross sections.
Other systematic errors are from the uncertainty of the fitting
of the mass distributions and the detector efficiencies.

for $p+p$ and $p+d$. The $d \sigma / d p_T^2$ differential

the parametrization $d\sigma/dp_t^2 = c (1+p_t^2/p_0^2)^{-6}$\cite{kaplan1978}
and the results of the fits are shown in \cref{fig:cs_pT}.

The $\sigma(p+d)/2\sigma(p+p)$ ratios for $J/\psi$ production are shown in
\cref{fig:pdpp} as a function of $x_F$.
As a result of the identical target geometry
of the two liquid targets and the frequent interchange between the targets,
most of the systematic uncertainties cancel out in the
$(p+d)/(p+p)$ cross section ratio. The remaining uncertainties in the
SeaQuest $(p+d)/(p+p)$ $J/\psi$
and $\psi^\prime$ cross section
ratios shown in \cref{fig:pdpp} have dominant contributions from the uncertainties
associated with the extraction of the yields $Y$.

Also shown in \cref{fig:pdpp} is the $(p+d)/(p+p)$ $J/\psi$
and $\psi^\prime$ cross section
ratios measured by the NA51 Collaboration~\cite{abreu1998} with \SI{450}{\GeV} proton
beam. Both the NA51 and the SeaQuest
results show the cross section ratios for $J/\psi$
production are closer to unity than for
the Drell-Yan process~\cite{dove2023}, also
shown in \cref{fig:pdpp}.

\end{figure}


The difference between the Drell-Yan and the charmonium
cross section ratios clearly reflect the different underlying mechanisms in
these two processes. The Drell-Yan process, dominated by the
$\bar u u$  annihilation subprocess, leads to the relation
\begin{align}
	\sigma(p+d)_{DY}/2\sigma(p+p)_{DY} & \approx &
	\frac{1}{2} (1+ \bar u_n(x_t)/\bar u_p(x_t)) \nonumber                                        \\
	                                   & =       & \frac{1}{2} (1 + \bar d_p(x_t)/\bar u_p(x_t)),
	\label{eq:DY}
\end{align}
where $\bar q_{p,n}$ denotes the $\bar q$ distribution in the proton ($p$)
and neutron ($n$), respectively. \Cref{eq:DY} clearly shows that the Drel-Yan
cross section ratios are sensitive to the sea-quark flavor asymmetry
$\bar d(x) / \bar u(x)$. For charmonium production, the dominance of the
gluon-gluon fusion subprocess at this beam energy implies that
\begin{align}
	\sigma(p+d \to J/\psi)/2\sigma(p+p \to J/\psi) \nonumber \\
	\approx \frac{1}{2} (1+ g_n(x_t)/g_p(x_t)),
	\label{eq:jpsi}
\end{align}
where $g_{p,n}$ refers to the gluon distribution in the proton
and neutron, respectively. As gluon is an iso-scalar particle, one expects
$g_p(x) = g_n(x)$ and \cref{eq:jpsi} leads to identical charmonium production cross
section per nucleon for $p+p$ and $p+p$. This prediction of identical
per nucleon cross section for $p+p$ and $p+d$ will be modified once the
contribution from $q \bar q$ annihilation is included, as discussed in the
next Section.

	Should we replace this section with NRQCD?
}
To compare the measured $p+d / p+p$ cross section ratios for charmonium
production with theoretical expectation, we have performed calculation
using the Next-to-Leading order (NLO) Color Evaporation
Model (CEM)~\cite{fritzsch1977}.
An important feature of the CEM is that it is essentially parameter-free,
with only a single parameter that accounts for the probability of a
heavy quark-antiquark ($\bar Q Q$) pair to hadronize into a specific
quarkonium bound state. Despite its simplicity, the CEM
gives a good description of many features of fixed-target $J/\psi$
cross section data with proton and pion beams~\cite{schuler1996,chang2020},
including their longitudinal momentum ($x_F$) distributions.

Taking charmonium production as an example, the NLO CEM first
produces a $\bar c c$ pair via various QCD hard processes at
the NLO~\cite{mangano1993}.
For $\bar c c$ pair with an invariant mass $M_{\bar c c}$ smaller than
the $D \bar D$ open-charm threshold, a
constant probability $F$, specific for each charmonium state,
accounts for the hadronization of $\bar c c$ pair into the colorless
charmonium state.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the simultaneous measurement of the charmonium
production and the Drell-Yan
dimuons in the SeaQuest experiment allows a direct comparison between
the $(p+d)/(p+p)$ cross section ratios for these two distinct reactions.
While the Drell-Yan process proceeds via electromagnetic interaction sensitive
to the quarks and aniquarks, the charmonium production is a strong interaction
process sensitive to the gluon contents of the colliding nucleons. These
different characteristics between the two processes are clearly reflected
in their different $(p+d)/(p+p)$ cross section ratios. While the ratios for
the Drell-Yan process is significantly different from unity as a result of
the flavor asymmetry of the light-quark sea, the charmonium production
cross section ratios are found to be consistent with unity. This result
is in qualitative agreement with earlier measurement at higher beam energy
by the NA51 Collaboration, as well as the $\Upsilon$ production at 800 GeV
by the E866 Collaboration. A combined analysis of these data is expected
to provide a sensitive test on the assumption of identical gluon
distributions in the proton and neutron.
